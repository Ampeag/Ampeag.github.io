### Ninjabrugger 
- This is a project called the ninjabrugger. For this project we had to design a machine that, using only preplaced platforms on an aluminium bar, would reach the other side. 
- It was a group project, where it was decided that we would use a system inspired by a gondola. I was put in charge of the vertical movement of the gondola.
