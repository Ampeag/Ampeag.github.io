### Ninjabrugger 
- This is a project called the ninjabrugger. For this project we had to design a machine that, using only preplaced platforms on an aluminium bar, would reach the other side. 
- It was a group project, where it was decided that we would use a system inspired by a gondola. I was put in charge of the vertical movement of the gondola.
  
  The machine part of the vertical movement consisted of 2 parts, the frame and the foot. The foot was made of several machined pieces of aluminium, to which were mounted several pieces.
    - Sheet metal aluminium shelves, acting as feet for the system
    - 4 shafts with plain bearings to keep the system stable
    - A rack as part of a rack and pinion system, which made the vertical movement posible.
      
  The frame was made of 2 millimeter thick steel, painted to combat corrosion. In this frame was mounted a wormdrive motor for the pinion of the rack and pinion system, the plain bearings and the wheels needed for    horizontal movement.
